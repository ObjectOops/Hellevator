___

Play as *Dante*, a twelve-year-old who fell into hell by **sheer accident** after cheating on his math test!  
Work for your new "boss", *Mephistopheles*, as an elevator operator - judging the *crimes* on the **life receipts** of ghosts, spirits, souls (whatever you call them) and transporting them to their "eternal punishment"!  
Gain or lose your boss's trust, all while under the pressure of time (as he has high expectations of your efficiency), or be ***doomed***!
